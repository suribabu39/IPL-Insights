Insights into IPL Dataset - Data Mining

Data consists of first 9 seasons. I would be exploring some interesting insights
1) Player with least/most inconsistency runs
2) Highest contribution(Percent of runs) in partnership
3) Highest contribution to team (runs)
4) Highest consecutive matches with atleast taking 1 wicket
5) Highest contribution to team (wickets)
6) If IPL played as league which teams would have won IPL
7) Highest unbeaten/winless streaks on each team
